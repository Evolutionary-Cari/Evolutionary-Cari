- 👋 Hi, I’m @Evolutionary-Cari
- 👀 I’m interested in urban ecology and evolution! My Ph.D. thesis is focused on understanding the host-parasite relationship of Cimex lectularius, the common bed bug, and humans at mutliple geographics scales. Using genome-wide SNPs from individuals collected across the United States, I've mapped their local and regional population structure to infer their patterns of dispersal in relation to host demographics.
- 🌱 I’m currently honing my skills in Python, R and Linux. One of my favorite things is to automate repetitive tasks with nested loops in a parent script that writes and submits multiple daughter scripts to maximize efficiency in data analysis and drastically reduce the time needed to complete an analysis.
- 💞️ I’m looking for a post-doc or full-time position after I graduate where I'll get to use the skills I've developed to continue studying anthropogenic impacts on species ecology and evolution.
